Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk
The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic
Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports
IAM customer managed policies that you create should not allow wildcard actions for services

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
 Limit the traffic on the Security Groups allow only secure ports such as 80, 443. 
 Set IAM policies for not allowing root user and to enforce MFA, as well as the specific permissions.
