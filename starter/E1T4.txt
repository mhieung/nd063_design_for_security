Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
IAM Role has full S3 access,making it a potential target for attackers. If the role's credentials are compromised, an attacker can abuse the role's permissions to perform unauthorized actions on S3 resources.
This also violates the least privilege principle. There should be different roles with different privileges for different users

# Poor practice 2
The WebAppSG allows all egress traffic to any IP address, which can lead to unintended data leakage. 
If sensitive information is transmitted to unauthorized IP addresses, it can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the secret recipe data.
