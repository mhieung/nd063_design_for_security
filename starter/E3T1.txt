# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
i-0b20af4c0d365ef95 is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.65. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
Based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_concepts.html: 
"To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in your AWS environment, GuardDuty analyzes and processes data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to detect anomalies involving the following AWS resource types: IAM Access Keys, EC2 Instances, and S3 Buckets. While in transit from these data sources to GuardDuty, all of the log data is encrypted.".
In this exercise, the source of information is located in VPC Flow Logs, which is stored on S3
