# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Implement CloudFront in front of the load balancer and attach a rule that prevents any external SSH attemps to the server instances.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Using VPC private endpoints would not prevent unauthorized access to the secret bucket

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, only new objects will be affected by the modification.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All the configuration made through the AWS management console would be dismissed.
